Hello! If you've found a security vulnerability in one of my projects, I'd truly appreciate a responsible report.

Scope

This policy covers my public code repositories (e.g., on GitHub, Gitea) and live demos/deployed instances that I directly host and manage. Please do not test third-party services, perform DoS attacks, or engage in social engineering.

Guidelines for Reporting

- -	Don't Break Anything: Avoid damage, service interruption, or data modification.
- -	Minimal Access: Only gather enough info to confirm the vulnerability.
- -	No Public Disclosure (Yet): Please don't share details publicly until I've confirmed a fix.

How to Report

Please email a detailed report to: contact@anchietae.cc

Include: Project Name, What You Found, How to Reproduce It, Potential Impact, and any Proof of Concept. Let me know if you'd like credit!

My Commitment

I'll acknowledge your report within 2-3 days, investigate it, fix valid issues, and update you when resolved.
